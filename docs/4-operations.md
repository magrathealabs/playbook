# Operations

Here we describe some of the practices we use to run the organization. Managing spaces, cash flow and taxes can feel difficult, but getting them right is vital to our success. Our problems are not unique. Some principles have helped us streamline our operations:

* Outsource things which are super important but we're not excellent at
* Try manual processes first
* Automate repetitive processes
* Give everyone access as much as possible to avoid bottlenecks
* Avoid building internal tools

## Space

We're a company prepared to work with remote teams, but we prefer to have everybody at the office in order to build strong relationships. Building a good space to work on is hard. Making sure we have coffee, tea and good snacks take time.

As a small and young company, we would have to spend a lot of time and money creating a pleasant working environment. That's why we work on [Fliperama Espaço Colaborativo](http://fliperamaec.com.br/), a coworking space that serves us with everything we need.

## Email, calendars and documents

We use Google Apps for Work to manage calendars, write and share documents. There is a MLabs folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't see it when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send you the link, and then click “Add to drive”.

When we write new things, we try to save them in a sensible folder within the existing structure.

## Video conferences

Usually we use Google Meet or Slack calls.

We also have a dedicated channel on [appear.in](https://appear.in/magrathealabs).

## Expenses

From time to time, some of us spend our own money at work. Most often, this is things like:

* Uber or taxi fares for unexpected travel
* Refreshments purchased for meetings with clients
* Materials, especially for workshops or events

MLabs will always pay expenses which are:

**Necessary**: We only expense things we need in order to be able to complete our work

**Proportionate**: The total expense should be proportionate to the work at hand. In general, we try to avoid spending lots of money

### Accounting

[Trentini Contabilidade](http://www.trentinicontabilidade.com/) provides us the services for bookkeeper, controller, tax accountant, labor law support, strategy planning and guidance about the regulatory environment.

We use [Conta Azul](https://contaazul.com/) to make our financial organization easier.  It helps keep everything organized in one place. There we have our bank account connected to automatically import and categorize transactions.

[Felipe&Silva](mail:alissa@felipeesilva.com.br) provide us with support to solve routine bureaucratic jobs that we can't automate. We love the work Alissa does helping us focusing on what we're really good on by managing all the operations making sure payroll happens regularly and correctly, making sure we pay partners promptly, preparing our taxes, making sure cash flow, checking account and savings account are in order.

## Legal

[Silveira Schneider Advogados](http://www.silveiraschneider.com.br/) is our law firm. They are able to provide us with legal support, not only with contracts and agreements, but also with with strategy planning and guidance about the regulatory environment, markets and opportunities.

## Devices

MLabs provides one notebook with external monitor, keyboard and mouse to every member of the team.

Some of us use personal device as part of our work, because it's more convenient than carrying lots of devices around. However, no one is obligated to use a personal device for work. If you need a phone, tablet or other device, please ask for one.

Anyone who does use a personal device must take reasonable care to ensure that it cannot compromise MLabs and client's security. This includes implementing prudent security measures, being mindful that your personal devices could be targeted as part of an attack on MLabs or its clients.

Some good practice are:

* Configuring screens to lock after a period of inactivity
* Ensuring that work-related data on the device is regularly backed up
* Encrypting storage
* Using good passwords and 2FA
* Avoiding connecting devices to untrustworthy networks (internet cafes, security conferences, unencrypted (open) Wi-Fi networks, etc)
* Disposing of your device securely when you no longer need it

## Books

If there is a book relevant to your work that you would like to read, let the team know and we will buy it for the library.
