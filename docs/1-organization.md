# Organization

We're a human organization specialized in engineering software products and services. We're here to help other organizations improve their productivity and to prepare people for the future.

We want to be recognised by our peers in the industry for solving problems using good software engineering practices and data science. We know how to create minimum viable products and also complete solutions through a systemic vision and good business understanding. We know how to communicate and how to sell what our customers need.

## Purpose

> [...] the future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed
> <br>â€” *William Gibson*

Why Magrathea Labs exists?

Our purpose is to **create better worlds**. We believe that there is a lot of knowledge out there that we can use to help others solve their problems. The problem is that this knowledge is not evenly distributed, so it is in our hands to learn how to do things and apply them in our local communities.

As a business, we do this by solving our customers' problems using technology in an effective and innovative way, designing and engineering software systems, doing data analysis and applying artificial intelligence. We also work in our local community and schools by organizing events to spread knowledge.

## Principles

There are four principles that guide us.

**We care**: we don't say *"I told you"* or *"this is not my responsibility"*. We take responsibility for our work and look for ways to improve it constantly.

**We're actively transparent**: what matters most in team software development is communication, and we actively communicate. We share the problems with each other. Communication is essential for creating a sense of team, and active cooperation.

**We're a team**: we are team players and committed partners. We share responsibilities. We don't let our egos take control of ourselves. We win and lose together. We don't have positions; we have roles. We could disagree with each other, but we commit to the team.

**We're different**: we seek out, respect and deeply value ideas, disciplines and experiences different from our own, knowing that this richness is fundamental to delivering our best work. We're a team of bacon lovers and vegans. We're members and non-members of LGBT community. Some of us love Python, and others love Ruby.
