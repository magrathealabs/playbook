We encourage everyone to be an expert using his/her favorite programming tool. Know every shortcut and automate repetitive tasks to gain more productivity so you can focus on building the software the way we want.

Use [dotfiles](https://github.com/alfakini/dotfiles) to automate our environment setup. Use an extensible code editor like Vim/NeoVim or Sublime Text 3. Here is the minimal configs for your code editor:

* Remove trailing whitespace
* Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, etc, tabs with 2 spaces
* Python tabs with 4 spaces

!!! attention
    Create and `.editconfig` for this
