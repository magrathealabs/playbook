# Starting new projects

## Before starting

It is very important to define the process and the involved people's roles before starting the project.

Are we going to use the client's process? What is the input and output of the development phase? What is the definition of ready of a task? What are the people that are the point of contact in each side?

### Definition of Done

A Definition of Done drives the quality of work and is used to assess when a User Story has been completed. Done means coded to standards, reviewed, implemented with unit Test-Driven Development (TDD), tested with 100 percent test automation, integrated and documented.

The Definition of Done ensures everyone on the team knows exactly what is expected of everything the team delivers. It ensures transparency and quality fit for the purpose of the product and organization. It limits the cost of rework once a feature has been accepted as DONE. Having an explicit contract limits the risk of misunderstanding and conflict between the development team and the customer.

We should include Feature Scenarios describing the requirements     of the product. We should deliver acceptance tests based on the Feature Scenarios.

Our DoD is:

* Feature is tested against acceptance criteria
* Unit/functional tests written and passing
* Integration tests passing
* CI successful build and linters passing
* Peer code review performed and issues resolved
* Project deployed and working on the test environment identical to production
* UX designer and QA reviewed and approved
* Client approved

### Definition of Ready

Is the product backlog item written as a User Story, well defined and clear enough for the development team to start working on it? Follow [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest) helps you remind of the good characteristics of the User Stories.

**Independent**: the item has the ability to be moved around, taking into account its relative priority without much effort. If you find items that are tightly dependent, a good idea might be to combine them into a single item.

**Negotiable**: while the item lies in the product backlog, it can be rewritten or even discarded, depending on business, market, technical or any other type of requirement by team members.

**Valuable**: the item brings actual project-related value to the stakeholder.

**Estimable**: if an item's size cannot be estimated, it will never be planned, tasked, and, thus, become part of an iteration. So there's actually no point in keeping this kind of item in the Product Backlog at all.

**Small**: try to keep our items sizes to typically a few person-days.

**Testable**: bear in mind that an item should only be considered DONE, among other things, if it was tested successfully. If one cannot test a item due to lack of information, the item should not be considered a good candidate to be part of an iteration Backlog. This is especially true for teams employing TDD.

### Roles

At the beginning of the project, it is defined who handles each role, and how to communicate amongst the team and the client.

Who is responsible for the QA? Who is responsible for deploying to production? Who is responsible for work priorization? The client will deliver mockups and prototypes for us or are we going to use our design process internally?

### Proof of Concept

Before starting any project that use a new technology, we find it extremely helpful to test a PoC (Proof of Concept). This reduces the chance of a failure and problems because of things that are out of our control.

For example, we had to add React into an architecture of a client and we experienced several problems to test the components. If we had added a simple Hello World component with tests before starting the project, we would have identified this problem and better estimated the effort to deliver the project.
