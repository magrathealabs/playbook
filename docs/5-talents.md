# Talents

We do not recruit people. We do not hire resources. We discover and help to develop talents. We're looking for people who are proud of their craft and wanting to evolve their careers.

We're constantly looking for new people to join the team, but we're not in a hurry. Our hiring process take 3 to 4 weeks to complete.  We don't want to make a mistake by hiring the wrong person.

The first way we find people is through our networks. We look for people we know. The second way is on Meetups and events, local or online professional communities. The third way we find people is by making sure we're regularly blogging about what we're doing, and being open about our culture, work and process.

We know what we will get when we hire our teammates in this way. We know they will take initiative because they voluntarily contributed to the community, to open source. We know their coding style. We know their personality and energy level from the local and online  professional communities.

## Scorecards and job descriptions

Before we decide to advertise a new job, we write a [scorecard](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-scorecard-for-making-better-hiring-decisions). This helps us make sure we all agree on what we need, and helps candidates to know if their skills are a good for the job. A Scorecard contains the position mission, the outcomes expected from the person, and the competencies needed for the job. The outcomes and competencies need to be things that we can have a go at understanding by asking questions and observing a candidate's behaviour.

Throughout the rest of the process, we'll use this document to decide what questions to ask in the meetings.

Based on the scorecard, we write a job description that contains:

* What we expect for the position
* What career opportunities we're offering
* The competencies we're looking for
* How would be a typical day of work
* The process that the applicant will follow

It's important for the job descriptions to be declarative and as objective as possible.

Almost everything we know about discovering and how to bring the best talents to the team we learned from the books [Who](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4989687-who), [Scaling Up](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22212880-scaling-up) and [Management 3.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10210821-management-3-0). Take a look on them.

## Hiring process

If someone in the company knows and likes you, we will send you an e-mail. If you come to us, you should apply in our [careers web page](http://www.magrathealabs.com/careers/).

Each candidate moves through a number of stages before being offered a job or declined: a screening interview via phone, a meeting to know the company, a meeting to discuss code with engineers and a meeting to close the deal.

We feel strongly that it's important to be respectful of candidates time and interest in us, and that their attention is valuable. So we do our best to be responsive, human and open. It's particularly important to give unsuccessful candidates good, through feedback about why we haven't made them an offer.

This is the process we follow:

1. Someone recommends you, or you apply to a position
2. Someone at MLabs will send you an e-mail to schedule a call
3. We call you to know you better and to introduce the company and what we're doing here
4. If we like you, and you like us, we schedule a meeting in our office so our team can know you better
5. If you have a cultural fit with us, in the next meeting we will talk about code
6. If everything goes as expected, we schedule a meeting to discuss the terms
7. You start working with us ðŸŽ‰

### Applicant tracking

We track each candidate's progress through the process on the [ATS workspace on Airtable](https://airtable.com/tblDPnrrwTu2qHsQR/viwBgGEWMFGPCeyoT). We manually add candidates or they are created automatically by the forms we use in our [careers web page](http://www.magrathealabs.com/careers/).

### Screening

The purpose of the screening is to:

* Introduce ourselves and explain a little more about the job and life at MLabs
* Talk to the candidate about their experience and explore why they are interested in the job
* Decide whether you think they are quite likely to have the experience and personal qualities that we're looking for
*  Know how they heard about the job

We try to keep the conversation quite high-level, and avoid going into too much technical detail. This part of the process is more about experience and personal qualities than about skills. Things we try to explore during the conversation:

* Does this person seem likely to share our values?
* Does this person have an interest in our purpose?
* The person working experience
* What the person thinks about its own personality and qualifications

We avoid making any commitments during this call. Near the end, we explain that we'll be in touch soon.

After the call, we can talk about the candidate with the team if we wish, or just make a decision. If we think its quite likely that they have the skills, experience and personal qualities that we need, we should take them through to the first meeting.

### Culture meeting

Candidates who have a successful screen will be offered a meeting. This is an hour long with two or three members of the team.

Before going to an interview, set aside enough time for the interview. We should leave half an hour each side in case the candidate is early or the interview goes long. Make sure you have:

* Read the job description
* Read the candidate's CV
* Read the [questions for the interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/122snZj5ya9aEmMAenR_8nDszMRFvJM-1ih0rQ4L6gHY/edit), and thought about whether they are the right things to ask

Our interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation, rather than Q&A. We do not recite the list of questions or keep verbose notes on replies. The questions are there to ensure that we don't forget to cover important ground, and as a prompt when the conversation naturally dries up.

The first thing we do when the candidate arrives is to show the office to him. Then, we start with a couple of questions, and then allow the conversation to evolve naturally. We ask questions about things they say, and try to go into more detail on the points that we think will help to assess their skills, experience and personal qualities. Keep the scorecard in mind: this should always be your frame of reference.

At the end of the interview, always ask the candidate if there's anything they would like to ask. If they have questions, answer them honestly. When everything's done, we thank the candidate for their time and then return to the office and discuss the interview. As soon as possible, we put a thorough update on Airtable. This update should include the good things and bad things about the candidate, a recommendation on whether to take them forward, and a rationale for that recommendation. It is very important that this update is detailed enough for us to understand what happened and why, long after everyone involved has forgotten all about it.

If we think the candidate is very likely to have the competencies, experience and personal qualities we need, we should take them through to the code meeting by sending them an [e-mail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/122snZj5ya9aEmMAenR_8nDszMRFvJM-1ih0rQ4L6gHY/edit).

### Code meeting

The code meeting is exactly the same as the first interview, but with different members of the team and [different questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/122snZj5ya9aEmMAenR_8nDszMRFvJM-1ih0rQ4L6gHY/edit). In this meeting we talk about code and technical aspects.

### Deal meeting

This is the last meeting. Sometimes, when we already know the person, it will happen with the code meeting.

This is the time we discuss salary expectations, compensations and make an offer to the candidate. After this, the process ends with the candidate accepting or rejecting our offer.

In the first day your mission is to setup your desk, machine, present yourself to your colleagues and know how our space works.

### First Week

## Apprenticeship

In our apprenticeship program, apprentices have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art technologies and put their skills to the test by working on real projects during a trial period.

The apprentices don't need to be proficient in a specific area. We're eager to meet people with the right attitude and skills. We look for smart and well motivated people that like to work in teams and to learn new things.

Once the apprentices finishes the apprenticeship program, they have the chance to become part of the MLabs.
