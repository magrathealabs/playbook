# Sharing

Sharing knowledge is extremely important for us. We learn a lot from others by attending conferences, reading blogs and code on GitHub. Here we describe how we give back to our community by sharing knowledge.

## Blog

We blog because we want to share what we're doing and what we're learning about technology, business and innovation. When we're hiring, we also want potential new staff to be able to get to know us a bit beforehand. Writing introductory blog posts and following up with communicating about the work we do helps people gauge what kind of team we're.

We collect ideas for blog posts on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/zdmuA1MN/mochileiros-blog), where we discuss them before being written. Often, we'll pick up ideas from this board on our investment time.

You can find our posts on [blog.magrathealabs.com](https://blog.magrathealabs.com).

## Internal talks

Internal talks are a good way to share knowledge with other members of the team and also a way to practice for talks we're going to give on meetups and conferences.

## Meetups

We help to organize some local meetups related with what we work at MLabs. We also speak in some of them. Every team member is encouraged to give talks on meetups and help organize them.

These are some of the meetups we help organize:

* [Agile Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Agile-Joinville)
* [Blockchain Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Joinville-Blockchain-Meetup)
* [Data Science Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/data-science-joinville)
* [Elixir Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Elixir-Joinville)
* [Python Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/python-joinville)
* [Ruby Joinville](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Ruby-Joinville)

## Conferences

We all go to events and conferences, sometimes for work and sometimes in our free time. Speaking at events is a great opportunity to represent MLabs. There are a couple of ways this can be valuable.

If we're hiring, we can mention this towards the end of the talk. Tell people what roles we're looking for and that they're welcome to speak to you after the talk about it in more detail. Also make sure to have a short link to the job description in your slides.

The most important thing to remember is that you'll leave the best impression - personally and for the company - if your talk is interesting, useful and well-presented. It takes time to make talks that work well. If you need help, advice or time to prepare, don't be afraid to ask for it. It's also good to blog after the event, to talk about your experience and what you learned.

On request, MLabs will cover the cost of a conference ticket. If you're going to speak at a conference related with what we do at the organization, we cover the cost of travel and accommodation, anywhere in reach of a budget flight.

## Monthly Hackday

Once a month we run a hackday. This event is based on the [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/businesses) initiative. It's a special day in which we contribute to open source projects, prototype stuff, test new technologies, write blog posts or create new products. During the month we [collect ideas](https://trello.com/b/6Qg8rle1/guia-dos-mochileiros) and on the last Friday of the month we choose some of them to work on.

## Open Source Software

Open source is part of our philosophy. Since our inception, we've been an open source focused company, improving code shared by others, putting effort in writing code and generally supporting the open source movement. We build our products using open source tools almost exclusively.
