## Purpose

!!! quote
    [...] the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed
    <br>— *William Gibson*

Why Magrathea Labs exists?

Our purpose is to *transform the future into the present*.

We do this by solving our customers' challenging problems using technology in an
effective and innovative way, designing and engineering software systems, doing
data analysis and using Artificial Intelligence.

## Principles

**We care**. We don't say *"I told you"* or *"this is not my responsibility"*.
We take responsibility for our work and look for ways to improve it constantly.

**We are actively transparent**. What matters most in team software development
is communication, and we actively communicate. We share the problems with each
other. Communication is essential for creating a sense of team and active
cooperation.

**We are a team**. We share responsibilities. We don't let our egos take control
of us. We win and lose together. We don't have positions; we have roles. We
could disagree with each other, but we commit to the team.
