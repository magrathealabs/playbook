We want to be recognized by solving problems using good Software
Engineering practices and Artificial Intelligence. We know how to create minimum
viable products and also complete solutions through a systemic vision and good
business understanding. We know how to communicate and how to sell what our
customers need.

We are here to help other organizations improve their productivity and to
prepare people for the future that is already here.

## Purpose

!!! quote
    [...] the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed
    <br>— *William Gibson*

Why Magrathea Labs exists?

Our purpose is to *transform the future into the present*.

We do this by solving our customers' challenging problems using technology in an
effective and innovative way, designing and engineering software systems, doing
data analysis and using Artificial Intelligence.

## Principles

**We care**. We don't say *"I told you"* or *"this is not my responsibility"*.
We take responsibility for our work and look for ways to improve it constantly.

**We are actively transparent**. What matters most in team software development
is communication, and we actively communicate. We share the problems with each
other. Communication is essential for creating a sense of team and active
cooperation.

**We are a team**. We share responsibilities. We don't let our egos take control
of ourselves. We win and lose together. We don't have positions; we have roles.
We could disagree with each other, but we commit to the team.
