others about:

* What was good
* What was bad

## Montly Hacker Day

Once a month we run a Hacker Day. This event is based on the
[Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/businesses) initiative.
During the month we [collect ideias](https://trello.com/b/6Qg8rle1/guia-dos-mochileiros)
that we should work on and in the last Friday of the month we choose some of them
to work on. The thing we work on can be fixes or improvements to open source
software, some prototype, testing new technologies, blog posts or some new
product.
