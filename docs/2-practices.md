# Practices

Here we describe some of our practices.

## Weekly Update

Once a week we do a standup meeting so we can communicate others about:

* What we've been doing
* What we learned
* What was good
* What was bad
* What can be improved

## Montly Hacker Day

Once a month we run a Hacker Day. This event is based on the
[Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/businesses) initiative.
It's a special day in which we contribute to open source projects, prototype
stuff, test new technologies, write blog posts or create new products.
During the month we [collect ideas](https://trello.com/b/6Qg8rle1/guia-dos-mochileiros)
and on the last Friday of the month we choose some of them to work on.

## Quarter Update

Once a quarter we run a meeting to update everyone with the current status of the
company and plans for the future. We talk about:

* Major company announcements
* Our culture: what we're doing that is good and what should we improve as a team
* An overview of our current and new customers
* Sales Pipeline
* Cash flow: a summary of the major incomming and outgoing funds and debts
