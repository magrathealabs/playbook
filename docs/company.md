# Our Company

!!! quote
    [...] the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed
    <br>— *William Gibson*

We are here to help organizations improve their productivity and to prepare people for the future that is already here.

The people of Magrathea are passionate about the unknown and by solving problems with technology.

We want to be recognized as the bests at solving problems using good Software Engineering practices and Artificial Intelligence. We know how to create minimal viable products and also complete solutions through a systemic vision and good business understanding. We know how to communicate and how to sell what our customers need.

## Purpose

Why Magrathea Labs exists?

Our purpose is to *transform the future into the present*.

We do this by solving our customers' challenging problems using technology in an effective and innovative way, designing and engineering software systems, doing data analysis and using Artificial Intelligence.

## Principles

**We care**. We don't say *"I told you"* or *"this is not my responsibility"*. We take responsibility for our work and look for ways to improve it constantly.

**We are actively transparent**. What matters most in team software development is communication, and we actively communicate. We share the problems with each other. Communication is essential for creating a sense of team and active cooperation.

**We are a team**. We share responsibilities. We don't let our egos take control of us. We win and lose together. We don't have positions; we have roles. We could disagree with each other, but we commit to the team.

# Projects Planning

!!! quote
    Plans are nothing; planning is everything
    <br>— *Dwight D. Eisenhower*

!!! quote
    [...] as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know [...]
    <br>— *[Donald Rumsfeld](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/There_are_known_knowns)*

Writing plans for projects is important. In any form and size, a plan provides a framework to organize the neural pathways in your mind and to make the raw information available in an accessible way to the rest of the team in a way to have a future reference. However, do not stick to a plan. A project plan does not capture everything. Changes happen all the time, and unfortunately, a plan usually fails to capture the randomness of life.

All projects are specified in PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) in our [Google Drive Projets folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6m7dowklNjvUTVIcURiazBoM2s).

All projects have some accompaniment docs:

* [Commercial Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sESbIJ_I53wYpENJo8iZU5TcdfZK8tZlzEwkfzPj4_w/edit)
* [Project](https://docs.google.com/a/magrathealabs.com/document/d/1IU_-NaHIaXniNpa-qpl_55tIdeLmi5TYVDpbrSTc-jk/edit)
* [Contract](https://docs.google.com/a/magrathealabs.com/document/d/1Xhk0-s2k5ONhC2Z8gpXpPzlFagnDH7Y7D208jq-D69U/edit)
* [Project Completion Term](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KF3qVysLKTRBIS8-f6dxW64N-HyatC_UplUtzBDyrwM/edit)
* [NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lY-N5sT8BX-YWKflEqt-m1HPdY5rzS02g1cIB6WtSfE/edit)

We start the project with the commercial proposal, with a broad vision of the project's estimates and costs. We write this document to start negotiating with our customers. Them, we write the project, with requirements and functional specs. The project document is attached to the contract. When finishing a project, we give to our customer the project completion term, where we list what we have done and ask for feedback about our work. In some projects, we also use a particular NDA document.

We like to work in phases, iterating with customers to prioritize, test and learn about what we're doing. We implement MVPs to explore the potential of our ideas, scaling the ones that worked:
